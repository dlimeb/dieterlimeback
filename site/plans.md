When you work with me, you do all the hard work. You begin to see your true self and recognize your inherent capabilities. **You receive the tools to release the past, create more beneficial habits, build new skills, and seek support where needed.** And you get my encouragement every step of the way.

Expect a mix of cognitive, emotional and physical exercises:
self-reflection, self-observation, self-adjustment, and a lot of
experimentation to see what works best.

As your coach, I don’t try to give you the answers to your own life, but instead will help guide you in a positive direction. **I will be an ally, a sounding board, and a mirror.** There are no judgments, no evaluations, and most of all, no pre-defined path. We’ll figure it all out together along the way.

Coaching has a myriad of definitions and approaches. There are life
coaches, executive coaches, career coaches, and so on. But to me, **people are whole human beings** whether we’re at work, at home, or anywhere in between. We bring all of who we are into every context of our lives, and **improvement in one area naturally leads to improvement in all others**. My coaching takes all of you into account.

Coaching can be thoughtful, or difficult.  It can be full of laughter and perhaps tears.   It is safe and respectful, and exhilarating and challenging.  It evolves and surprises and unfolds.  Would you want any less?

Coaching is best perceived as a process. While many people start creating new awareness and initial change in a short time, to refine and sustain this change takes longer.

The program I'm offering will run for approximately 3 months, can be held in person or via phone/video call, and includes:

Achieve your goals faster with guidance and accountability

Have someone in your corner to help you master workplace communication, develop a positive mindset, grow your leadership skills and more.

This is not coaching where I judge, criticize, give you advice, or nag you. Instead you will have me as your champion, supporter, listener, and accountability partner as we work together to discover new clarity, confidence, and ways of being for you. You can expect me to adhere to and uphold the [ICF Code of Ethics](https://coachfederation.org/code-of-ethics). I will be deeply committed to you, act professionally, respect your circumstances, and hold all our interactions in the strictest of confidentiality. Additionally, as part of my certification process I will be under the mentorship of a Master Coach.
As your coach, I help you identify your blind spots, overcome your self-imposed obstacles, and fulfill your true potential.
### You will receive:

- A **personalized coaching program** tailored to your specific issue (including the purpose and intended outcomes of our coaching engagement)
- **Recommended practices and exercises** to help create the desired shift
- **Private twice-monthly one-hour sessions**, for a minimum of 12 sessions, to check on your progress, discuss new insights and address any challenges

### Our Coaching Timeline

### Part 1: Determining Your Desired Destination

- **Session 1: Getting to know you.** I will spend 90
minutes asking you a myriad of questions about all areas of your life to get the full picture of your current situation. My clients have said
these questions teach them so much about themselves in just one session.
- **Session 2: Offering a program.** After taking some
time to assess and plan, I will present you with the proposed purpose
and outcomes of our coaching engagement together. This includes a clear
articulation of the shift that needs to be made in terms that will give
you a fresh perspective on your journey. I will then offer a preliminary practice and exercise for you to take on to begin creating that shift,
and together we’ll discuss ways to stick to doing them.

### Part 2: Ensuring You Reach Your Destination

- **Sessions 3-12: Providing ongoing support.** Every
hour-long session will begin with you sharing your progress, including
any insights gained and obstacles encountered. I will then offer
additional practices and exercises to maintain your momentum or refocus
your efforts as needed. I will also help you reframe challenges that
arise to see them in a new light, as indications of or opportunities for continued growth.

### Part 3: Enjoying Your Destination to the Fullest

- **Taking a break.** The initial program is 12 sessions
over a period of 6 months. Upon completion, we will reflect back on
where you were when you began and where you are now, drawing attention
to the shift you’ve created for yourself. Now is your chance to revel in the rewards of your hard work.
- **Sessions 13-15: Checking in.** We will have follow-up sessions scheduled 1, 3 and 6 months after your program completion.
During these sessions, you will share your new insights from this
vantage point, and we’ll discuss any practices or exercises that need to be tweaked to keep the momentum going. Everything you’ve learned up
until now will be reinforced and deepened.

### Part 4: Deciding Where to Go Next

- **Sessions 16-?: Extending your program.** Once our
engagement comes to a close, you may choose to continue working with me
or end there. The decision is yours. If you renew, together we will
identify a new issue to tackle, and the cycle will begin again.
