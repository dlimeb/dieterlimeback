Hello friend,

If you're reading this it's because I feel you might be interested in -- or can help with! -- something new I'm diving into.

As you may know, last year I took steps to bootstrap a new phase of my career and began investigating coaching. While some form of coaching has been in my leadership skillset for years, I wanted to level up more formally, so I took an extensive training course with [CTI](https://coactive.com/), the largest and most established professional coach training organization in the world.  I am now embarking upon a more rigorous certification process, and as part of that I am looking for an initial cohort of clients. I have **5 slots remaining** for a 4 month program starting in March.

If you're interested in coaching, or know someone who might be, read on. This is a great opportunity to get a lot of value without paying higher rates.


## What's coaching?

Coaching is all about becoming aware of and connecting you to what truly brings you alive. It helps you discover and align to your values, understand how to make powerful choices, and take deliberate action. It's a holistic and often powerfully transformative process that can open you to new insights and possibilities.

Coaching is for anyone and any aspect of life. It can move you forward if you're feeling frustrated or stuck, or help you progress from good to great in areas you're doing well. If you have a career opportunity or role transition to navigate, a complicated relationship to untangle, new health and wellness goals to hit, or want to learn how to stay present and grounded despite life's ups and downs, coaching is for you.

We all want to become better versions of ourselves. So pause a moment and check in with yourself: Are all parts of your life where you want them to be? How much are you _focusing_ on creating that better you? What is now the time for?



## The program

Coaching is best perceived as a process. While many people start creating new awareness and initial change in a short time, to refine and sustain this change takes longer.

The program I'm offering will run for approximately 4 months, can be held in person or via phone/video call, and includes:

- 10 individual sessions biweekly (~1 hour each)
- Personalized coaching tailored to your needs, context, and goals
- Recordings or notes of each session for follow-up review
- Resources and reference material
- Email or text support between sessions

This is not coaching where I judge, criticize, give you advice, or nag you. Instead you will have me as your champion, supporter, listener, and accountability partner as we work _together_ to discover new clarity, confidence, and ways of being for you. You can expect me to adhere to and uphold the [ICF Code of Ethics](https://coachfederation.org/code-of-ethics). I will be deeply committed to you, act professionally, respect your circumstances, and hold all our interactions in the strictest of confidentiality.

Additionally, as part of my certification process I will be under the mentorship of a Master Coach.

## Price

The pilot program is $750 for the entire package described above. This is intended to reflect a respect for our time, your commitment to your growth, my extensive experience in leadership and management, and my 100+ hours of intensive training and practice. At the same time, it is also heavily discounted to reflect the fact that I am not yet certified. This is a fantastic opportunity to discover what personalized coaching can do for you.
