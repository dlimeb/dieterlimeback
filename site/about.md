I am a **Professional Certified Coach** credentialed by the International Coach Federation, a **Certified Integral Coach** through [New Ventures West](http://newventureswest.com/), and certified coach in Social and Emotional Intelligence assessments.

My approach to coaching — integration of mind, heart and body — is based on the belief that people lose themselves when we’re thinking one
thing, feeling another thing, and acting another way entirely. **We become our most powerful selves when our thoughts, feelings and actions are working in tandem.**
// stolen from elsewhere:

I've had an eclectic career spanning industries (technology and startups, non-profits, food and beverage, cosmetics, recruitment) and functions (marketing, community management, sales and people operations). After playing key hiring roles in companies such as Yelp, and advising 25+ startups, I now focus on coaching new leaders and career transitioners in the technology/digital space.

Influenced by a multitude of coaches, teachers, leaders and inspiring humans, path has taken her on a rich journey of experiences and responsibilities.  has been fortunate throughout her career to work for companies that invested in their leaders and worked to develop them both personally and professionally leading to a belief that personal development is professional development and the best leaders focus on both.

has over 25 years of experience in business and almost two decades of experience in leadership roles including leading both teams and businesses. ’s natural ability to connect, her high emotional intelligence and her drive to deliver value to others has led to her success across partnerships, business development, sales and product roles.  as well as having worked for a number of strong leaders, has influenced her belief system and her understanding of the impact leaders can have on a team and an organization, for good, bad or worse.

Having spent time at both large corporations  and start-ups, has first-hand experience in: leading through ambiguity, change management, hiring & developing people, diversity & inclusion, and scaling a business. But beneath it all is an underlying belief that in order to be a great leader, you must first do the work to know yourself. Self-awareness - understanding your strengths, where you need help, what your biases are and that you do, indeed, have blind spots - is the first step. Without this knowledge, you will not only get in your own way but you will get in the way of your team, your peers and your business.
