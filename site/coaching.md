  <p class="faq__question">
    What's the difference between coaching and therapy?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>While both are aimed at helping people make positive changes in their life, and there can be some overlap in style and approach, there are also some important differences to consider.</p>
    <p>Therapists are licenced medical professionals and as such often work with people with substantial mental health issues, substance abuse problems, severe trauma, or another clinical condition. Therapists typically focus on the <em>past</em> to uncover underlying causes for current behaviour, and seek to understand a pathology or determine a diagnosis.</p>
    <p>Coaches work with people who are largely functioning well but feeling they are not reaching their true potential. Coaching  is not diagnostic in nature and does not consider clients as defective in any way. Instead coaches help clients identify their own goals and uncover obstacles or limiting beliefs which may be blocking them. Coaching tends to focus on the <em>present and future</em> rather than the past, and is action-based, placing emphasis on accountability and progress towards the client's goals.</p>

  <p class="faq__question">
    What's the difference between a coach and a mentor?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>Although the words <em>coach</em> and <em>mentor</em> are often used interchangeably, and they often share a conversational or facilitative approach, they're different roles in how they relate to you.</p>
    <p>A mentor directly advises you -- they bring substantial subject matter experience to the table, sharing hard-won expertise, wisdom, and personal opinions. Mentors typically act as though <em>they</em> have the answer, and it's their job to pass it on to you.</p>
    <p>A coaching relationship is more unbiased and objective. The coach doesn't possess or require any subject matter expertise, and instead proceeds primarily by listening, and by asking powerful questions to help you develop new awareness and insights. Coaches act as though <em>you</em> have the answer, and it's our job to help you connect to it.</p>

<div class="faq">
  <p class="faq__question">
    How long does coaching take to work?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>Coaching can work quickly, or slowly, or both.</p>
    <p>Many people start creating new awareness and initial change in a short period of time, and it's not uncommon to have a "light bulb" moment. Coaching where something shifts for the client can happen inside a 10 minute conversation. However, coaching is best perceived as a process. To refine and sustain these changes, and truly incorporate them in your life, takes longer, on the order of months.</p>
    <p>In addition, while it's common to see effects of coaching during a session, it's also <em>between</em> sessions where a lot of change happens, as your mind, body, and spirit work to incorporate new perspectives and energy.</p>
