  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>
coactive model is about being AND doing

    I am a CPCC—Certified Professional Co-Active Coach. I received my training from the prestigious Coaches Training Institute (CTI), the largest coach training school in the world. CTI’s founders were among the initial pioneers of the coaching profession, and their textbook is widely known as the definitive text on coach training. A Co-Active coach believes first and foremost in the power of people to transform their own lives. Co-Active coaches use an array of proprietary tools developed by CTI that have been proven as the gold standard over the past 20 years of the coaching profession.
