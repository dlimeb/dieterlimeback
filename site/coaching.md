## What to expect

Coaching provides a safe and supportive space for you to create the life you want. This involves self-reflection and stretching towards new clarity and ways of being for you. You'll experience a range of thoughts and feelings, but above all coaching is authentic and energizing.

Coaching works with you as a whole person. This means all aspects of your life are relevant, not only the topic at hand. This also means developing a mix of intellectual, emotional, and physical awareness, as we thrive when all are in alignment.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to coaching, so expect a lot of experimentation and adjustment as we discover what works best for you.

Finally, it's not my role to evaluate, judge, criticize, advise, or nag you. Instead I act as your champion, supporter, listener, and accountability partner. You can expect me to be deeply committed to you and the change you wish to bring about.

  <p class="faq__question">
    Who is coaching for?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>Coaching is for anyone. If you have a vision for an improvement you want to make, and the motivation to do something about it, coaching is for you.</p>
    <p>Coaching is also for any aspect of life. Whether you have a career opportunity to navigate, a complicated relationship to untangle, new health and wellness goals to hit, or want to learn how to stay present and grounded despite life's ups and downs, coaching can help.</p>

  <p class="faq__question">
    How long does coaching take to work?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>Coaching can work quickly, or slowly, or both.</p>
    <p>Many people start creating new awareness and initial change in a short period of time, and it's not uncommon to have light bulb moments. Coaching where something shifts for the client can happen inside a 10 minute conversation. However, coaching is best perceived as a process. To deeply understand, refine and sustain these changes and truly incorporate them into your life takes longer, on the order of months.</p>
    <p>In addition, while it's common to see effects of coaching during a session, it's also <em>between</em> sessions where a lot of change happens, as your mind, body, and spirit work to incorporate new perspectives and energy.</p>

  <p class="faq__question">
    What's the difference between a coach and a mentor?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>Although <em>coach</em> and <em>mentor</em> are often used interchangeably, and they may share a conversational or facilitative approach, they're different in how they relate to you.</p>
    <p>A mentor directly advises. They bring substantial subject matter experience to the conversation, sharing hard-won expertise, wisdom, and personal opinions. Mentors typically act as though <em>they</em> have the answer, and it's their job to pass it on to you.</p>
    <p>A coaching relationship is more unbiased and objective. The coach doesn't need to possess any subject matter expertise, and instead proceeds primarily by listening, and by asking powerful questions to help you develop new awareness and insights. Coaches act as though <em>you</em> have the answer, and it's their job to help you connect to it.</p>

  <p class="faq__question">
    What's the difference between coaching and therapy?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>While both are aimed at helping people make positive changes in their life, and there can be some overlap in style and approach, there are also important differences to consider.</p>
    <p>Therapists are licenced medical professionals and as such often work with people with substantial mental health issues, substance abuse problems, severe trauma, or another clinical condition. Therapists typically work with just the issue before them, focus on the <em>past</em> to uncover underlying causes for current behaviour, and seek to render a diagnosis.</p>
    <p>Coaches work with people who are largely functioning well but feel they're not reaching their true potential. Coaching is not diagnostic in nature and does not consider clients as deficient in any way. Instead, coaching helps clients identify their own goals and uncover obstacles or limiting beliefs which may be blocking them. Coaches work with the whole person, focus on the <em>present and future</em> rather than the past, and is action-based, placing emphasis on accountability and progress towards the client's goals.</p>

    What is Co-Active coaching?
  </p>
  <div class="faq__answer">
    <p>Co-Active is a philosophy and model for human development pioneered by the <a href="https://coactive.com/">Co-Active Training Institute</a> (CTI), the largest in-person coach and leadership training organization in the world. CTI's founders were among the initial pioneers in the coaching profession, their textbook is considered the definitive text on coach training programs worldwide, and CTI was the first organization accredited by the <a href="https://coachfederation.org/">ICF</a>.</p>
    <p>Based on scientific principles, the CTI model focuses on both being <em>and</em> doing, and fundamentally believes in the power of people to radically transform their own lives. <a href="https://coactive.com/about/what-is-coactive/">Learn more</a> at the CTI website.</p>
